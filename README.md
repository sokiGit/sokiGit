Hi! I'm a high school student interested in cybersecurity, programming, game dev, and anything related to computers.
<br/>
My biggest passion is cybersecurity. I love learning new stuff, so I have gained *some* experience with many technologies over the years. From UI/UX design all the way over to hardware hacking.
# I always learn new stuff.
## Currently learning
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
<br/>
Some recent practice projects:
- [Click counter](https://github.com/sokiGit/PRG_RS-click_counter_0)
- [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/sokiGit/caesarcipher)
- [LogAnalyzer](https://github.com/sokiGit/LogAnalyzer)
- [Remaking all Java school assingments in Rust](https://github.com/sokiGit/PRG2F_Rust)
- [A testing game in Rust + Bevy](https://github.com/sokiGit/RustGaem)

# Where I have the most experience
## UI/UX Design

Technologies I have experimented with relation to web development.
<br/>
PyQt - For building GUI applications in Python (with PySide6) (see my [Session Sniffer-inspired project](https://github.com/sokiGit/meowmeowmeowmeow))
<br/>
And there's probably much and much more. So much, in fact, that I can't even remember it all, and it'd be too much for a simple README anyway haha
